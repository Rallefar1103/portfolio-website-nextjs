      "Since joining Turf Tank's tech team in August 2020, I've played a significant role in its growth from four to over 50 engineers. I led the development of a key Flutter app, enhancing user engagement with our autonomous line marking robot benefiting over 2600+ customers across 15 countries. Beyond this, I developed a React web application to streamline subscription management for operations before shifting my focus to backend development, where I was tasked to generate and optimize our geometric sports layouts. My efforts in refactoring the layouts engine improved code quality and maintainability by over 30%, achieving a 70% code coverage. My tenure at Turf Tank is defined by significant responsibility and a deep impact on product quality and efficiency",
